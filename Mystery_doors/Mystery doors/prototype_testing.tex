\chapter{PROTOTYPE TESTING}

Testing is the activity conducted to detect the errors or exceptions in the system. It is a quality management process carried on so that the product can be checked with the expectations of the system. The system is tested in two phases with unit and system testing unit testing is carried on and when the each module is coded. After the successful completion of each modules the system is integrated and validated through a complete testing to creep the errors. The software is tested with the necessary test cases to verify the accuracy of the product developed.
\paragraph\ \hspace{0.5cm} Test cases are the checking conditions for knowing whether the program or the part of the program is working properly. The test cases or defined before we start implementing the code. The test cases are at module level and system level as well. The test cases for our program are as follows:
