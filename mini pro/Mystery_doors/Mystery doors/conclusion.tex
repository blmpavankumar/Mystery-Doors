\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}

\section{Conclusion}
With a large and growing user base that generates large revenues but also raises numerous technological applications, Mobile Games have recently started to attract the interest of the research community. In this work we have tried to identify the availability of the puzzle-based games in Windows phone Operating System. To address this, we have designed and implemented “Mystery Doors”, a puzzle-based gaming application for Windows phone. Our architecture focuses on puzzle game, which is one of the most important components of the generic game. \\
\section{Future Work}      
This puzzle based game application can be enhanced and can be made more interesting by adding further levels with more features. We can also include functionality of random generation of puzzles. We can also make use of database system and isolated file storage system for storing puzzles and images.\\
